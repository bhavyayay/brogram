# 🚀 WHY BROGRAM?

Fitness apps today often behave like SaaS products:

❌ Onboarding  
❌ Log-ins  
❌ Trackers  
❌ Subscriptions  
❌ Feed Systems  
❌ Gamification  

Brogram asks:

> **“What if fitness didn’t need a tutorial?”**

It prioritizes:

✔ Low cognitive overhead  
✔ Fast consumption  
✔ Immediate usability  
✔ Mobile-first clarity

2. **Frugality** — lightweight CSS, no UI bloat  
3. **Actionability** — clear, scannable workouts  
4. **Focus** — “Scroll → See → Do” execution loop
