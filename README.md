## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> _Fitness shouldn’t require a tutorial._

The UI focuses on:

- zero cognitive overload
- clean typography
- instant consumption
- minimal colors
- actionable information

---

## 🧠 Motivation & Origin

Most fitness apps bombard users with:

- logins
- trackers
- paywalls
- multi-step onboarding
- social feeds

Brogram is the opposite — a simple routine that respects users’ time and discipline.

---

## 🚧 Roadmap (Future Enhancements)

Planned upgrades:

- ⬜ Dark mode
- ⬜ Workout timers & rest intervals
- ⬜ Difficulty filters
- ⬜ Beginner / Intermediate / Pro levels
- ⬜ Add videos / GIF demos
- ⬜ Offline support (PWA)
- ⬜ Save routine & streak tracking
